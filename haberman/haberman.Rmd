This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#HABERMAN DATASET
```

```{r}
library(DataExplorer)
```

```{r}
data <- read.csv(file.choose(), header = T)
```

```{r}
head(data,20L)
```
```{r}
data$Survival[data$Survival=="negative"]<-"-1"
data$Survival[data$Survival=="positive"]<-"1"
```
```{r}
head(data)
```
```{r}
create_report(data)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
